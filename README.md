# Job Tracker API Component test

This is some component testing for my express and node project using Cucumber, Rest Assured, Faster-Jackson, JUnit and implementing a Builder Pattern for object instantiation. 

## How to Run
To run these api tests, make sure you have the local server running through the Job Tracker back end. At this repos: https://github.com/Edajve/job-tracker-back-end-service.git

Read the README on that project, spin the server up and run the api tests.
